- For setting up a Go workspace, refer to the [official documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).
    - Create your workspace directory, $HOME/go. (If you'd like to use a different directory, you will need to [set the GOPATH environment variable](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH).)
