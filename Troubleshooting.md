-  Are looking for a logical and structured approach to problem solving through distributed systems, network and web scenarios. 
-  Make sure you understand the questions and ask appropriate follow-up questions to the interviewer when needed. 
-  A big part is finding out what the actual problem is and breaking it down into specifics. 

# GCP
For example if your web server goes down over the weekend, how do you get notified? Or how do you identify which IP address to blacklist, for your HTTP load balancer?
- What if your server goes down in the middle of the night or over the weekend? Do you expect someone to always look at dashboards to determine whether your servers are available? Or have enough capacity or bandwidth? 
    - If not, you want to create alerting policies that notify you when specific conditions are met
- Analyze logs in **BigQuery** and visualize in **Data Studio**

# Identifying and Troubleshooting Performance Issues
- Add **performance test** to your test suite to ensure that the performance of your application doesn't degrade when you fix bugs, add new features, or change underlying software.
## Check **performance watchpoints** related to incoming requests
- Web Authoring
    - Web page design and implemenation
        - **[Pagespeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/)**
        - **Chrome DevTools**
- Cold-boot Performance
- Self-infliceted Load
    - Watch out for **self-inflicted load**. This is load caused by the application itself, such as **service-to-service** calls or **browser-to-service** calls. Check for self-inflicted load. This is load caused by the application itself, such as service-to-service or browser-to-service calls. For example, check for polling cron jobs, batch requests, or multiple Ajax requests from the browser. You can use client-side tools such as **Chrome DevTools** and server-side load analysis tools such as **Stackdriver** Trace to find the source of your problem.
## Review application code and logs
- Application Errors
    - Check logs for application errors, such as HTTP errors and exceptions. Identify the root cause of the log messages and confirm that they are not related to periodic load or performance issues. Prioritize investigation by the frequency of errors. Because this data is historical, some errors might have been intermittent or already resolved. If a log message is unreproducible, it might be better to do defer the investigation. 
- Runtime Code Generations
    - Aspect-oriented programming practices can sometimes cause reduced application performance. Consider compile-time code generation instead.
- Static Resources
    - Don't serve static resources from your application. Instead, use a content delivery network such as **Google Cloud CDN** with **Google Cloud Storage**.
- Caching
    - Database
- One-at-a-Time Retrieval 
    - Replace these individual requests with a single batch request or send a request in parallel. 
- Error-Handling
    - Don't retry constantly on errors. Instead, retry with **exponential backoff**. Implement a circuit breaker to stop retries after a certain number of failures. Note that you should only retry in case of errors such as connection timeouts or too many requests. Don't retry in case of errors such as 5xx errors and malformed URL errors and so on.
