## Non-Tech Skills
In addition to your technical skills, when you meet with your interviewer, they’ll be assessing you based on four attributes using a mix of behavioral and hypothetical questions: 
- General Cognitive Ability: 
    - W​e ask open-ended questions to learn how you approach and solve problems. 
    - And there’s no one right answer—your ability to explain your thought process and how you use data to inform decisions is what’s most important. 
- Leadership:​ ​
    - Be prepared to discuss how you have used your communication and decision-making skills to mobilize others. 
    - This might be by stepping up to a leadership role at work or with an organization, or by helping a team succeed even when you weren’t officially the leader.
- Role-related knowledge:​ ​
    - We’re interested in how your individual strengths combine with your experience to drive impact. 
    - We don’t just look for how you can contribute today, but how you can grow into different roles—including ones that haven’t even been invented yet.
- Googleyness:​ 
    - Share how you work individually and on a team, how you help others, how you navigate ambiguity, and how you push yourself to grow outside of your comfort zone.

### What's a behavioral question?
Using a behavioral interview technique like the **STAR** approach can help structure your answers.
- Situation
    - Describe the situation you were in or the task you needed to accomplish.
- Task
    - Explain the goal you were working toward.
- Activity
    - Detail the specific steps you took and the role(s) you played.
- Result
    - Describe your accomplishments and the overall outcome.

### What's a hypothetical question?
While behavioral questions assess your past performance, hypothetical (also known as situational) questions evaluate how you would handle a challenge you may not have encountered yet.
