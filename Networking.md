S​how off your depth of knowledge and understanding of network theory, like different protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP, etc), MAC addresses, IP packets, DNS, OSI layers, and load balancing. 
# Protocols
## TCP/IP
- The three-way handshake
            - Setting up a connection
            - Delivery acknowledgements
        - Retransmission
        - In-order delivery
        - Congestion control
        - Error detection
            - No improvement, but checksum is mandatory
        - Bigger heander
        - Data doesn't always get sent out immediately
        - Bigger overhead
        - Text communication
        - File transfers
        - Remote access (e.g. SSH)
## UDP
- Advantages
            - Small packet sizes
            UDP header: 8 bytes
            TCP header: 20 bytes
            - No connection to create and maintain
            - More control over when data is sent
        - No error recovery
        - No compensation for losing package
        - Packets can arrive out of order
        - Multimedia streaming
        - Some firewall block UDP
## ICMP
## HTTP
  - Each HTTP request includes 5 key elements/core components:
    - HTTP methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS,
    - URI(Uniform Resource Identifier)
    - HTTP version
    - Request Heander/metadata
    - Request Body
  - Each HTTP response includes 5 key elements/core components:
    - Status/Response Code: 200, 404, 503
    - HTTP Version: HTTP v1.1
    - Response Header
    - Response Body

| TCP/IP 4 Layers        | OSI MOdel 7 Layers     | 
| ---------------------- |------------------------| 
| Application Layer      | 7 - Application Layer  | 
|                        | 6 - Presentation Layer |   
|                        | 5 - Session Layer      |  
| Transport Layer        | 4 - Transport Layer    |
| Internet Layer         | 3 - Network Layer      |
| Network Access Layer   | 2 - Data Link Layer    |
|                        | 1 - Physical Layer     |

## Application 
- This consists of network aware applications like Email, Web Browsers, File sharing services, Print servers, Network drives, Twitter, Facebook
- Protocol
    - HTTP 80
    - HTTPS 443
    - SMTP
    - SSH
    - NTP
    - DNS 53
    - Telnet 23
    - FTP 20 and 21
- PDU - Data
- The **Data** is broken up into **Segments** which use Ports to identify services
- Clients are dynamically assigned ports from 8000 to 65535

## Presentation
- Job is to configure the data: encryption, compression, translation

## Session
- It's job is to control the communication: login rights, permissions, rights

## Transport
- It's job is to guarantee end to end delivery of data
- Purpose of the transport layer
    - Letting multiple applications use one network connection simulaneously
- Protocol
    - UDP(User Datagram Protocol)  
    - TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)

## Network
- Internet Layer for the 4 Layers Model
- Protocol
    - Internet Protocol (IP)
    - Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
        - A lightweight protocol used to carry error messages and information about a network
        - Function used by Ping
    - Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
- The Internet layer PDU is called a **packet**
- The IP packets use this addressing scheme: IP Addresses
- Ex. 192.168.100.254

## Network Access Layer
- Mostly uses **Ethernet Frames**
- Physical Address ex.
- 00.12.F4.AB.0C.82
- 00-12-F4-AB-0C-82
- 0012.F4AB.0C82
- 48 bit hexadecimal number
- Also called the "**MAC address**"

### Data Link
- Ethernet or WiFi
- PDU - Frames

### Physical
- coaxial Ethernet cable
- PDU - Bits

  - Why? 
    - HTTP protocol has been implemented as stateless protocol, so there is a need of some featrues in web technology to maintain state of user either at client or at server.
    - Record user session state
  - Ads
  - Disadvantages
    - Cookies are maintianed at client system, so that they are not secure
    - Limited number of cookies are allowed for website (Max 20)
    - Limited amount of data can be maintained (Max 4KB)
    - Only plain text can be maintained
    - Privacy/security
  - Usage
    - To maintain authentication details we can make use of authentication cookie
    - To transmit session ID between client and server
