- The Kubernetes control plane (master)

Customers are responsible for managing the EKS work nodes.

What is the recommended method to update EKS worker nodes to a new version of Kubernetes?

#### eksctl
eksctl is an open source tool for managing EKS clusters developed by Weaveworks and AWS

[LAUNCH USING EKSCTL](https://eksworkshop.com/eksctl/)

```
eksctl is a tool jointly developed by AWS and Weaveworks that automates much of the experience of creating EKS clusters.
```

```
$ eksctl create cluster -f example.yaml
```

- Autoscaling node groups
    - Define a maximum and minimum number of nodes and scale based on cluster load.

#### upgrade
You are responsible for updating the EKS **worker node**.

There are 2 ways
1. Node group
2. CloudFormation

What is the recommended method to update EKS worker nodes to a new version of Kubernetes?
