What approaches should you use to protect data in transit for the application? (Choose 2 answers)
- A. Use BitLocker to encrypt data.
- B. Use HTTPS with server certificate authentication.
- C. Use an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role.
- D. Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) for database connection.
- E. Use XML for data transfer from client to server.

Answer: B and D. To protect data in transit from the clients to the web application, HTTPS with server certificate authentication should be used. To protect data in transit from the web application to the database, SSL/TLS for database connection should be used.

## The Shared Responsibility Model
|              |
|--------------|
|User Data     |
|Application   |
|Guest OS      |
|--------------|
|Hypervisor    |
|Network       |
|Physical      |

Question: Which of the following are true about the AWS shared responsibility model? (Choose 3
answers)
- A. AWS is responsible for all infrastructure components (that is, AWS Cloud services) that support customer deployments.
- B. The customer is responsible for the components from the guest operating system upward (including updates, security patches, and antivirus software).
- C. The customer may rely on AWS to manage the security of their workloads deployed on AWS.
- D. While AWS manages security of the cloud, security in the cloud is the responsibility of the customer.
- E. The customer must audit the AWS data centers personally to confirm the compliance of AWS systems and services.

Answer: A, B, and D. In the AWS shared responsibility model, customers retain control of what
security they choose to implement to protect their own content, platform, applications,
systems, and networks, no differently than they would for applications in an on-site data
center.

## Security Compliance
Components of AWS compliance
- Risk management
- Control environment
- Information security

Your customers are concerned about the security of their sensitive data and their inquiry asks
about what happens to old storage devices on AWS. What would be the best answer to this question?

_Explanation: When a storage device has reached the end of its useful life, AWS procedures
include a decommissioning process that is designed to prevent customer data from being
exposed to unauthorized individuals.
AWS uses the techniques detailed in DoD 5220.22-M (“National Industrial Security Program
Operating Manual “) or NIST 800-88 (“Guidelines for Media Sanitization”) to destroy data as part
of the decommissioning process.
All decommissioned magnetic storage devices are degaussed and physically destroyed in
accordance with industry-standard practices.
